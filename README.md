## Locally Weighted Regression
Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) uses Euclidean Distance to 'weight' different data points based on their distance to the data points that are closer to the one we are trying to predict. The closer a data point is to the point we are trying to predict the heavier the weight will be. In this regression we will not split the data into train and test splits. 

The code below uses the cars.csv file to show LWR in action.
